## Project 1: Brainrot Scene
I originally wanted to do a spinning 67 with two hands moving up and down just to mess with people, but I realized that the transformations would be too simple. I wanted to create something where I wouldn't be restricted by it "making sense" and have the freedom to experiment and create cool transformations. The resulting monstrosity features 4 characters from "brainrot" memes:

- Ballerina Capuchina
  - One of the "Italian brainrot" characters. This image was AI generated, but not by me. Italian brainrot is a meme format with very wacky AI generated characters in nonsensical videos. I animated her dancing in a figure eight pattern.
- Maxwell the Cat
  - A cat popular from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXh8Hvo7gfs (probably not the original but this is the format). I did my best animating him spinning in 3d even though it's a 2d sprite. I also made him orbit around the ballerina.
- Skibidi Toilet
  - The creation of this meme could honestly get its own history book. The "series" (yes, it's a series) was created by a Russian YouTuber named "DaFuq!?Boom!". It has become synonymous with brainrot memes and gen alpha humor, even receiving merch items, mobile games, and Fortnite skins. In the videos, the head pops out of the toilet, so I animated him popping up and down from the bottom of the screen.
- LeBron James "Sunshine"
  - This is a lesser known meme from 2024, that originated with the pairing of the song "You are my Sunshine" and videos of LeBron James, mocking diehard LeBron fans. Somehow there was an image of him edited where he was "the sunshine" which got made into a Roblox item, and the png I actually used is of the roblox item. I animated his head spinning and bouncing up and down, as if it was a dribbling basketball.
